Little Game Client
==================

The little game client is a Unity project to display the state of the game and
 allow the user to interact. Here we handle the physics of the simulation and
 notify the server of any pertinent events: collisions, user input, etc.

Note that no _little code_ is evaluated here. The server handles this and
 informs the clients of any state change.
